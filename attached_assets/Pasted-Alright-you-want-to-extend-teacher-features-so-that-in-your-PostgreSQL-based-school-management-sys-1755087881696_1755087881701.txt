Alright — you want to extend teacher features so that in your PostgreSQL-based school management system, a teacher can:

Create tasks (assignments, quizzes, tests) with customizable timers.

Create meetings like Google Meet.

Assign both tasks and meetings to specific sections.

Notify students so they can join.

I’ll map this into PostgreSQL schema + feature flow for you.

PostgreSQL Tables for Teacher Features
sql
Copy
Edit
-- ===============================
-- 1. Tasks (Assignments, Quizzes, Tests)
-- ===============================
CREATE TABLE teacher_tasks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    teacher_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    section_id INT REFERENCES sections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    task_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- Assignment, Quiz, Test
    timer_minutes INT, -- NULL if no timer
    due_date TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- ===============================
-- 2. Student Submissions
-- ===============================
CREATE TABLE task_submissions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    task_id INT REFERENCES teacher_tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    student_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    file_url TEXT,
    score DECIMAL(5,2),
    feedback TEXT
);

-- ===============================
-- 3. Online Meetings
-- ===============================
CREATE TABLE teacher_meetings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    teacher_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    section_id INT REFERENCES sections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    meeting_url TEXT NOT NULL, -- Google Meet or Zoom link
    scheduled_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    duration_minutes INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- ===============================
-- 4. Notifications
-- ===============================
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    recipient_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    link TEXT,
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Feature Flow
1. Creating a Task
Teacher logs into dashboard → clicks "Create Task".

Fills in: title, description, type (Assignment/Quiz/Test), section, timer (optional), due date.

Task is saved in teacher_tasks.

Notification is sent to all students in the section via notifications.

2. Student Submission
Students see tasks in their dashboard with a countdown timer (for timed tests).

After completion, they upload their file or answer → saved in task_submissions.

Teacher reviews and scores the submission → updates score and feedback in the same table.

3. Creating a Meeting
Teacher clicks "Create Meeting".

Enters title, section, date/time, duration.

Generates meeting_url (could be Google Meet API or manual paste).

Meeting stored in teacher_meetings.

Notifications sent to students in the selected section.

4. Joining a Meeting
Students see meeting details in their dashboard with Join button.

Clicking opens the meeting_url in a new tab.

Notification Example in Backend (Node + Express + PostgreSQL)
javascript
Copy
Edit
// sendNotification.js
async function sendNotification(pool, recipientId, message, link) {
    await pool.query(
        `INSERT INTO notifications (recipient_id, message, link) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)`,
        [recipientId, message, link]
    );
}
✅ With this design:

Teachers have full control over task types & timers.

Meetings work like Google Meet but are just links stored in the DB.

Students are instantly notified of new tasks or meetings.
