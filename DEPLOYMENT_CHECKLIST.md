# ✅ Hostinger Deployment Checklist

## 🔧 Files to Upload to Hostinger

Upload these files to your `public_html` directory:

### Required Files:
- [ ] `app.js` - Entry point for Hostinger
- [ ] `.htaccess` - Handles SPA routing
- [ ] `dist/` folder - Built application with MySQL support
- [ ] `node_modules/` - Dependencies (or run `npm install` on server)
- [ ] `package.json` - Package configuration

### Configuration Files:
- [ ] Create `.env` file with your MySQL credentials
- [ ] Set Hostinger app entry point to `app.js`

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Step 1: MySQL Connection String
Your DATABASE_URL should look like:
```
mysql://u870495195_school:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:3306/u870495195_school
```

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Set these in Hostinger control panel or .env file:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=mysql://u870495195_school:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:3306/u870495195_school
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
PORT=3000
```

## 🚀 Hostinger Settings

### Node.js App Configuration:
- [ ] **Entry Point**: `app.js`
- [ ] **Start Command**: `node app.js` 
- [ ] **Environment**: Production
- [ ] **Port**: 3000

### Domain Configuration:
- [ ] Domain points to correct directory
- [ ] SSL certificate enabled
- [ ] .htaccess file uploaded for routing

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After deployment:
1. [ ] Visit `https://admission.icnl-ict.com`
2. [ ] Check that app loads (no 404 error)
3. [ ] Test login functionality
4. [ ] Verify database connection works
5. [ ] Check Hostinger error logs if issues

## 🆘 If You Still Get 404:

### Common Issues:
1. **Wrong Entry Point** - Must be `app.js`
2. **Database Connection** - Wrong MySQL credentials
3. **File Permissions** - Files not readable
4. **Missing .htaccess** - Client routing won't work

### Quick Fixes:
1. Check Hostinger error logs
2. Verify all files uploaded correctly
3. Test database connection string
4. Ensure entry point is set to `app.js`

## ✨ What's Fixed:

✅ **Database Compatibility** - Now uses MySQL instead of PostgreSQL  
✅ **SPA Routing** - .htaccess handles client-side routes  
✅ **Entry Point** - Proper startup file for Hostinger  
✅ **Environment Config** - Production-ready settings  
✅ **Static Files** - Correct serving of React app  

Your app should now work perfectly on Hostinger! 🎉
